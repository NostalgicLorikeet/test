The iMac G3, originally released as the iMac, is a series of personal computers sold by Apple Computer from 1998 to 2003. Following Steve Jobs's return to the financially troubled company that he co-founded, he aggressively restructured its offerings. The iMac was envisioned as Apple's new inexpensive and consumer-friendly desktop product, focused on easy connection to the Internet. Apple's head of design Jony Ive and his team created a striking teardrop-shaped all-in-one design based around a cathode-ray tube display, shrouded in translucent colored plastic. The iMac eschewed legacy technologies like serial ports and floppy-disk drives in favor of CD-ROMs and USB ports. Selling more than six million units, the iMac was a commercial success for Apple, helping to save it from bankruptcy whilst influencing the look of future computers and consumer products. The original model was revised several times and was succeeded by the iMac G4 and eMac.
